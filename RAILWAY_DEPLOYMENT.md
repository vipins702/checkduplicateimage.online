# Deploy PHP App to Railway - FIXED

## Railway Deployment Error Fix:

The error "Error creating build plan with Railpack" happens because Railway needs proper configuration files.

## âœ… Fixed Configuration Files Added:

### 1. Procfile (tells Railway how to start your app)
```
web: php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT -t public_html
```

### 2. composer.json (defines PHP dependencies)
```json
{
    "name": "checkduplicateimage-online",
    "description": "Reverse Image Search Tool", 
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.0"
    }
}
```

### 3. railway.json (Railway-specific config)
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT -t public_html"
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps (After Fix):

1. **Commit the new files**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

2. **Go to Railway.app**
3. **Connect GitHub** and select your repository  
4. **Railway will now detect PHP** and build successfully
5. **Access your app** at the provided Railway URL
